# What is this?

This is an R package to handle truncated members from the exponential family.

# Installation

## Stable version

TruncExpFam is available on CRAN and can be installed by running the following in an interactive R session:

```R
install.packages("TruncExpFam")
```

## Development version

The development version of the package contains features and bug fixes that are yet to be published.
It is, however, much less stable than the CRAN version.
You can install the development version of TruncExpFam by running the following command in R (requires the `remotes` package to be installed beforehand):

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/TruncExpFam", ref="develop")
```

Finally, load the package with `library(TruncExpFam)`. A list of available functions can be printed with `ls("package:TruncExpFam")`.

Further details on installing TruncExpFam can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/TruncExpFam/wiki/Installing-TruncExpFam).

# Usage

For more information about the package (e.g. suppored distributions), run `?TruncExpFam` after loading the package in your R session.

Are you familiar with the stats package and its `r*` and `d*` functions such as `rnorm()` and `dpois()`? If so, you will feel right at home with `TruncExpFam`, which uses the `rtrunc()` function to generate random numbers and the `dtrunc()` function to generate probability densities.
