# What is this?

This is an R package to handle truncated members from the exponential family.

# Installation

TruncExpFam is currently under development. To install the package, first make sure you have either the "remotes" or the "devtools" package installed in your local R installation, then issue the following command:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/TruncExpFam")
```

Finally, load the package with `library(TruncExpFam)`. A list of available functions can be printed with `ls("package:TruncExpFam")`.

Further details on installing TruncExpFam can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/TruncExpFam/wiki/Installing-TruncExpFam).

# Usage

For more information about the package (e.g. suppored distributions), run `?TruncExpFam` after loading the package in your R session.

Are you familiar with the stats package and its `r*` and `d*` functions such as `rnorm()` and `dpois()`? If so, you will feel right at home with `TruncExpFam`, which uses the `rtrunc()` function to generate random numbers and the `dtrunc()` function to generate probability densities.

# Contributing

TruncExpFam is open-source software licensed by the GPL. All contributions are welcome! Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/TruncExpFam/issues) to submit any bugs you find or see what other issues have been submitted.

# Citing

If you present work that uses this package, please remember to cite it.

```{r cite, echo=FALSE}
citation("TruncExpFam")
```

You can also generate the output above on your R session by running `citation("TruncExpFam")`.
