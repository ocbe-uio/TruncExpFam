#' @title The Truncated Exponential Family
#' @description Random generation for the truncated exponential family
#' distributions. Please ferer to the "Details" and "Examples" section for more
#' information on how to use this function.
#' @param n sample size
#' @param a point of left truncation. For discrete distributions, `a` will be
#'  included in the support of the truncated distribution.
#' @param b point of right truncation
#' @param family distribution family to use
#' @param faster if `TRUE`, samples directly from the truncated
#' distribution (more info in details)
#' @param ... individual arguments to each distribution
#' @return A sample of size n drawn from a truncated distribution
#' @note The current sample-generating algorithm may be slow if the distribution
#' is largely represented by low-probability values. This will be fixed soon.

#' @author René Holst, Waldir Leôncio
#' @details One way to use this function is by calling the `rtrunc`
#' generic with the `family` parameter of your choice. You can also
#' specifically call one of the methods (e.g. `rtruncpois(10, lambda=3)`
#' instead of `rtrunc(10, family="poisson", lambda=3)). The latter is more
#' flexible (i.e., easily programmable) and more robust (i.e., it contains
#' better error handling and validation procedures), while the former better
#' conforms with the nomenclature from other distribution-related functions in
#' the `stats` package.
#'
#' Setting `faster=TRUE` uses a new algorithm that samples directly from
#' the truncated distribution, as opposed to the old algorithm that samples
#' from the untruncated distribution and then truncates the result. The
#' advantage of the new algorithm is that it is way faster than the old one,
#' particularly for highly-truncated distributions. On the other hand, the
#' sample for untruncated distributions called through `rtrunc()` will no longer
#' match their [stats]-package counterparts for the same seed.
#'
#' @return vector of one of the `rtrunc_*` classes containing the sample
#' elements, as well as some attributes related to the chosen distribution.
